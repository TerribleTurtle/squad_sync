# FluxReplay Plugins

This directory contains the source code for FluxReplay plugins.

## Structure

- `core/`: The core plugin SDK and shared types.
- `[plugin-name]/`: Individual plugin directories.

## Future Plans

We plan to support "Auto-Clip" plugins that can detect game events (e.g., kills, deaths, wins) and automatically trigger clips.
